# Problem

Derive the shared secret key and use it to decrypt the encrypted flag 

In deffie helman key exchange algorithm this is how the shared secret is generated 

Let us have two parties called Alice and Bob 

Step 1: Both parties will agree on two numbers P and G.

Step 2: Alice creates their own private key 'a' and Bob generates their own private key 'b'. These private keys are not shared

Step 3: Both parties generate a public key using the equation (G^privateKey) mod P. They then send this key to each other

Step 4: A shared private key is generated using (publicKey^privateKey) mod P. ALgaebrically this shared private key generated by both Alice and Bob are same.

Now from the question we have P and G and Alice's public key and Bob's private key which we can use to generate shared secret key 

```python
def calculate_shared_secret(p, alice_public_key, bob_private_key):
    # Calculate the shared secret using Alice's public key and Bob's private key
    shared_secret = pow(alice_public_key, bob_private_key, p)
    return shared_secret

# Example parameters
p = int(input("Enter P"))              # A prime number
alice_public_key = int(input("Enter alice's public key"))  # Alice's public key
bob_private_key = int(input("ENter bob's private key"))  # Bob's private key

# Calculate the shared secret
shared_secret = calculate_shared_secret(p, alice_public_key, bob_private_key)

print(f"Shared Secret: {shared_secret}")
```

Now we just put this shared secret key in the decryption algorithm provided in the question and we will get out flag 

`crypto{sh4r1ng_s3cret5_w1th_fr13nd5}`
