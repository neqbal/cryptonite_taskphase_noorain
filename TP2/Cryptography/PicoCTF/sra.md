### Problem 

We have to figure out N.

From the code provided we know the value of e \
Upon connecting to remote server we get the encrypted text and private key d \
From the code it is clear that we need to decrypt the cypher text and send it in order to get the flag.

The problem is that we only know d and e so we cannot directly compute N

I cannot figure out what to do here
