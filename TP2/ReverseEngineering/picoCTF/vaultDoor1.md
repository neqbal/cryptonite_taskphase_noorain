### Problem

Analyze the code and retreive the flag 

From the code it is clear that when flag is entered as a user input it checks each position of the entered string individually \
Only just that the sequence in which the positions are checked is shuffeled so we just have to arrange it and we will get the flag

`picoCTF{d35cr4mbl3_tH3_cH4r4cT3r5_f6daf4}`
