### Problem 

Retreive the flag


In this problem the `win` function is not called from within the game but it is present in game's memory. 

By decompiling the game we can see that the `win` function is written just after `main` function.

So in order to call the `win` function we have to change the value in at the address that holds the return address of the main function. 

The return address is held onto by the `EBP` register whose value is pushed onto the stack at the start of the function. 

So we just have to move the character in the game and reach the point in stack that holds the return address and change it to from where `win` function is written. So that when main function returns the program counter will point to the `win` function and start executing it.


LEA src, dest - Copies the value of src itself to destination \
EBP is the base pointer register 

```
PUSH EBP    ;save EBP 
PUSH EBX    ;save EBX
PUSH ECX    ;save ECX
```

These instructions saves the callers old registers and prepares to call another function which might require these registers 

The EBP register is used to manage the stack frame

```

+-----------------------+
| Parameter 2           | <- EBP + 12 (second parameter)
+-----------------------+
| Parameter 1           | <- EBP + 8  (first parameter)
+-----------------------+
| Return Address        | <- EBP + 4  (return address to caller)
+-----------------------+
| Old EBP               | <- EBP (points to saved base pointer)
+-----------------------+
| Local Variable 1      | <- EBP - 4  (first local variable, if allocated)
| Local Variable 2      | <- EBP - 8  (second local variable, if allocated)
