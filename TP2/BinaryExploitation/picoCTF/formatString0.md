### What is Format Function?
These are C functions such as printf, fprintf, which converts primitive variable of the program into human readable string representation.

The format string parameter like %x, %s defines the type of conversion of the format function.

In this challenge we have to utilise the format string vulnerability to get the flag.

    Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
    Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
    Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe

From the options we can see that the third option is the valid one because the program checks if the input buffers's size > 2 * BUFFSIZE
In the third input there is a format specifier `%114d`. This format specifier specifies that there will be a 114 characters wide integer which will increase the input size.

    Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
    Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
    Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak

From the options above the correct option is third one. `%s` format specifier prints the string on the stack.
