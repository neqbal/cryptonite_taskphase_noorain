From the source code 
```c
char *normal_string = "/bin/sh";
```

So it is clear we have to execute this command and get the root shell access and then find the file that contains the flag.

`system()` method is used to execute builtin from within `c`

This method is present in the `stdlib.c` header file 

But we are provided with a libc.so file so system function must be present in that

The input buffer is stored at an offset of 38

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,%38$llx,%39$llx,%40$llx
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,4847464544434241,504f4e4d4c4b4a49,5857565554535251
    /bin/sh

Next i think i will have to write a shellcode and insert it and then change the return address
