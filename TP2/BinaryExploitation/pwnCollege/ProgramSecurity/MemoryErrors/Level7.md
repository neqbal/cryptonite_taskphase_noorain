In this challenge the binaries are placed randomly in the processors memory
Which means it wont be at a fixed address space every time.

In Position independent code the instructions are mapped in processes memory page by page. 
A memory page is a contigiuos block of 0x1000 bytes starting at a page address aligned to 0x1000

A page address can look something like 

    0x5f7be1ec2000
    0x7ee1382c9000
    0x6513a3b67000

The instructions are mapped on these page addresses starting from 0x1000
So if the address of a function was `0x1337` then it will palced in the memory at the address `0x5f7be1ec2000 + 0x1337 = 0x5f7be1ec337` 

Due to this we can only know the last three digits and the first digit have to be brute forced

so we have to send this payload multiple times so that the last 4th digit in the page address is 0

payload 

    python -c 'import sys, time; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"150"); time.sleep(1); sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*121 + b"\x69\x18")' | ./babymem-level-7-0

The flag 

    pwn.college{U9AXdHs9xlfr1WcbGOGzRalITg5.0VMwMDL5kzM1czW}
