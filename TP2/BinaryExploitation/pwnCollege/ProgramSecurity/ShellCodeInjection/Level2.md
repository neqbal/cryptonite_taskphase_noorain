This problem is like level 1 but in this we have to add a portion of nop sleds because the program will skip some of it

```c 
int to_skip = (rand() % 0x700) + 0x100;
```

The maximum lines the programs skips is 2048

```asm
    .rept 2048
    nop
    .endr
```

Add these instruction at the begining of the asm code
