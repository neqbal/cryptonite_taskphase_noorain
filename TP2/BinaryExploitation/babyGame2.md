### Problem 

Retreive the flag


In this problem the `win` function is not called from within the game but it is present in game's memory. 

By decompiling the game we can see that the `win` function is written just after `main` function.

So in order to call the `win` function we have to change the value in at the address that holds the return address of the main function. 

The return address is held onto by the `EBP` register whose value is pushed onto the stack at the start of the function. 

So we just have to move the character in the game and reach the point in stack that holds the return address and change it to from where `win` function is written. So that when main function returns the program counter will point to the `win` function
